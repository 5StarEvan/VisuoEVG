# VisuoEVG

Welcome to VisuoEVG, a platform that provides interactive visualizations for various data structures and algorithms. This tool helps users gain a deeper understanding of how data structures and algorithms function through real-time graphical representations.

**Features**

- Data Structures: Supports visualization of stacks, queues, trees, and more.

- Algorithms: Implements and visualizes common algorithms such as BFS, DFS, and other graph traversal techniques.

- Real-Time Visualization: Dynamically updates visualizations as users interact with the system.

- User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive interface for exploring data structures and algorithms.

**Technologies Used**

- Backend: Flask (Python) with MySQL for data storage.

- Frontend: React, JavaScript, and D3.js for interactive visualizations.

- Database: MySQL (for storing user data, if needed).

# Devopment

VisuoEG was created and developed by Evan Guo. It serves the purpose of providing a visual representation of challenging algorithms and data structures in computer science, a topic that often stumps students at first.

# Project is still in development ...
